  "description": "Safety Manager: Hello everyone. We will now begin today's TBM. First, let's review yesterday's work.\nForeman: Yesterday, we completed the concrete pouring on the 3rd floor. The curing status is good, and today we plan to proceed with rebar arrangement on the 4th floor.\nSafety Manager: Okay, good. I will now explain today's key safety points. First, please ensure safety belts are worn during high-altitude work. Second, entry within the crane's working radius is prohibited.\nField Staff: Yes, understood. Also, the weather is cloudy, what are the precautions for rain?\nSafety Manager: Good question. In case of rain, immediately stop work and evacuate to a safe place. Especially, electrical work is strictly prohibited."
